## Hourly Automation Data Scraping Air Pollutant Index (API) 

### API Calculation 
Air Pollutant Index (API) is an indicator for the air quality status at any particular area. The API value is calculated based on average concentration of air pollutants namely SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10. The air pollutant with the highest concentration (dominant pollutant) will determine the API value. Normally, concentration of particulate matter , PM2.5 is the highest among other pollutants and determines the API value.
