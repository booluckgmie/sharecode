## Hourly Energy Generation from GSO:
As we strive to transition towards more sustainable energy sources, monitoring and analyzing energy generation becomes increasingly important. I'm delighted to announce that we have established an open data source that provides hourly updates on energy generation from the Grid System Operator (GSO). This data includes information on renewable energy production, fossil fuel usage, and overall energy supply. It will enable researchers, policymakers, and entrepreneurs to make informed decisions, optimize energy usage, and drive the clean energy revolution forward.
