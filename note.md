Key Challenges in Data Management (as shared by Sally and Najmi)
1. Lack of Standardization
Each Technology Partner (TP) used different systems — or had no system at all.

No common data format or structure across systems.

Smart Services also generating reports in their own formats.

2. Incomplete and Inconsistent Data
Some datasets only include name and IC, but are missing fields like race, etc.

Data gaps (missing values) are common due to inconsistent data input requirements.

3. Data Encryption & Access Issues
Certain personal info is encrypted — adds to complexity when trying to consolidate.

Not all stakeholders have ownership or access rights to relevant systems.

4. Compliance & Legal Constraints
Historical data may not comply fully with PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act).

Engaging agencies like MCMC or DOSM (PADU) to help fill data gaps requires strong justification.
